This report explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for CVD detection using a dataset containing various patient attributes. The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and model training using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XG Boost, Light GBM, and LSTM. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. The expected outcome is improved diagnosis and management strategies for CHD that can lead to better health outcomes. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques using numerical data. The importance of this research lies in its potential to advance patient care and contribute to better health outcomes for patients with CHD. Integrating machine learning techniques on diverse datasets is a comprehensive approach to CHD detection. This study highlights the need for integrated strategies to address the complexity of CHD. Continuous monitoring is about gaining insights into optimizing model performance and overcoming potential challenges when combining different data sources. Finally, this study aims to establish a more accurate and effective method to detect CHD.
