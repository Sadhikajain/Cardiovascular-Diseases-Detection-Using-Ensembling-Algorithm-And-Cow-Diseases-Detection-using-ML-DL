Description Of Project 1
This project presents a thorough framework for cow disease identification using a combination of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques in order to address this problem. The novelty of this study specifically focuses on the four common diseases that affect cattle: mange, ringworm, cowpox, and lumpy skin disease.A sizable dataset for this study was created by gathering a variety of samples from different groups of cattle. Veterinary specialists carefully labeled each sample to guarantee correctness and dependability. The new composition of the dataset makes a substantial contribution to the progress of veterinary diagnostics research.Several algorithms are integrated in the proposed framework, such as Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). With the help of its special talents, each algorithm contributes differently to the disease diagnosis process by drawing useful patterns and features from the data. Additionally, with a 98 percent accuracy rate, the CNN model demonstrated its efficacy in identifying and differentiating between various cow diseases by collecting complex spatial information.


Description Of Project 2
This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for CVD detection using a dataset containing various patient attributes. The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and model training using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XG Boost, Light GBM, and LSTM. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. The expected outcome is improved diagnosis and management strategies for CHD that can lead to better health outcomes. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques using numerical data. The importance of this research lies in its potential to advance patient care and contribute to better health outcomes for patients with CHD. Integrating machine learning techniques on diverse datasets is a comprehensive approach to CHD detection. This study highlights the need for integrated strategies to address the complexity of CHD. Continuous monitoring is about gaining insights into optimizing model performance and overcoming potential challenges when combining different data sources. Finally, this study aims to establish a more accurate and effective method to detect CHD
